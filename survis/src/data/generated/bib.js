        "abstract": "With the escalating global challenges of food security and resource sustainability, innovative solutions like deep learning and computer vision are transforming agricultural practices by enabling data-driven decision-making. This paper provides a focused review of recent advancements in deep learning-enabled computer vision techniques tailored specifically for greenhouse environments. First, deep learning and computer vision fundamentals are briefly introduced. Over 100 studies from 2020 to date are then comprehensively reviewed in which these technologies were applied within greenhouses for growth monitoring, disease detection, yield estimation, and other tasks. The techniques, datasets, models, and overall performance results reported in the literature are analyzed. Tables and figures showcase real-world implementations and results synthesized from current research. Key challenges are also outlined related to aspects like model adaptability, lack of sufficient labeled greenhouse data, computational constraints, the need for multi-modal sensor fusion, and other areas needing further investigation. Future trends and prospects are discussed to provide guidance for researchers exploring computer vision in the niche greenhouse domain. By condensing prior work and elucidating the state-of-the-art, this timely review aims to promote continued progress in smart greenhouse agriculture. The focused analysis, specifically on greenhouse environments, fills a gap compared to previous agricultural surveys. Overall, this paper highlights the immense potential of computer vision and deep learning in driving the emergence of data-driven, smart greenhouse farming worldwide.",

        "abstract": "Detecting objects remains one of computer vision and image understanding applications\u2019 most fundamental and challenging aspects. Significant advances in object detection have been achieved through improved object representation and the use of deep neural network models. This paper examines more closely how object detection has evolved in the era of deep learning over the past years. We present a literature review on various state-of-the-art object detection algorithms and the underlying concepts behind these methods. We classify these methods into three main groups: anchor-based, anchor-free, and transformerbased detectors. Those approaches are distinct in the way they identify objects in the image. We discuss the insights behind these algorithms and experimental analyses to compare quality metrics, speed/accuracy tradeoffs, and training methodologies. The survey compares the major convolutional neural networks for object detection. It also covers the strengths and limitations of each object detector model and draws significant conclusions. We provide simple graphical illustrations summarising the development of object detection methods under deep learning. Finally, we identify where future research will be conducted.",

        "abstract": "We present an interpretation of Inception modules in convolutional neural networks as being an intermediate step in-between regular convolution and the depthwise separable convolution operation (a depthwise convolution followed by a pointwise convolution). In this light, a depthwise separable convolution can be understood as an Inception module with a maximally large number of towers. This observation leads us to propose a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture inspired by Inception, where Inception modules have been replaced with depthwise separable convolutions. We show that this architecture, dubbed Xception, slightly outperforms Inception V3 on the ImageNet dataset (which Inception V3 was designed for), and signi\ufb01cantly outperforms Inception V3 on a larger image classi\ufb01cation dataset comprising 350 million images and 17,000 classes. Since the Xception architecture has the same number of parameters as Inception V3, the performance gains are not due to increased capacity but rather to a more ef\ufb01cient use of model parameters.",

        "abstract": "There are two major types of uncertainty one can model. Aleatoric uncertainty captures noise inherent in the observations. On the other hand, epistemic uncertainty accounts for uncertainty in the model \u2013 uncertainty which can be explained away given enough data. Traditionally it has been dif\ufb01cult to model epistemic uncertainty in computer vision, but with new Bayesian deep learning tools this is now possible. We study the bene\ufb01ts of modeling epistemic vs. aleatoric uncertainty in Bayesian deep learning models for vision tasks. For this we present a Bayesian deep learning framework combining input-dependent aleatoric uncertainty together with epistemic uncertainty. We study models under the framework with per-pixel semantic segmentation and depth regression tasks. Further, our explicit uncertainty formulation leads to new loss functions for these tasks, which can be interpreted as learned attenuation. This makes the loss more robust to noisy data, also giving new state-of-the-art results on segmentation and depth regression benchmarks.",

This paper traces the origins of machine vision, from early image processing algorithms to its convergence with computer science, mathematics, and robotics, resulting in a distinct branch of artificial intelligence. The integration of machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, has driven its growth and adoption in everyday devices. This study focuses on the objectives of computer vision systems: replicating human visual capabilities including recognition, comprehension, and interpretation. Notably, image classification, object detection, and image segmentation are crucial tasks requiring robust mathematical foundations. Despite the advancements, challenges persist, such as clarifying terminology related to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning. Precise definitions and interpretations are vital for establishing a solid research foundation. The evolution of machine vision reflects an ambitious journey to emulate human visual perception. Interdisciplinary collaboration and the integration of deep learning techniques have propelled remarkable advancements in emulating human behavior and perception. Through this research, the field of machine vision continues to shape the future of computer systems and artificial intelligence applications.",

Overfitting refers to the phenomenon when a network learns a function with very high variance such as to perfectly model the training data. Unfortunately, many application domains do not have access to big data, such as medical image analysis. This survey focuses on Data Augmentation, a data-space solution to the problem of limited data. Data Augmentation encompasses a suite of techniques that enhance the size and quality of training datasets such that better Deep Learning models can be built using them. The image augmentation algorithms discussed in this survey include geometric transformations, color space augmentations, kernel filters, mixing images, random erasing, feature space augmentation, adversarial training, generative adversarial networks, neural style transfer, and meta-learning. The application of augmentation methods based on GANs are heavily covered in this survey. In addition to augmentation techniques, this paper will briefly discuss other characteristics of Data Augmentation such as test-time augmentation, resolution impact, final dataset size, and curriculum learning. This survey will present existing methods for Data Augmentation, promising developments, and meta-level decisions for implementing Data Augmentation.

Event cameras possess a myriad of advantages over canonical frame-based cameras, such as high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, low latency, etc. Being capable of capturing information in challenging visual conditions, event cameras have the potential to overcome the limitations of frame-based cameras in the computer vision and robotics community. In very recent years, deep learning (DL) has been brought to this emerging field and inspired active research endeavors in mining its potential. However, there is still a lack of taxonomies in DL techniques for event-based vision. We first scrutinize the typical event representations with quality enhancement methods as they play a pivotal role as inputs to the DL models. We then provide a comprehensive survey of existing DL-based methods by structurally grouping them into two major categories: 1) image/video reconstruction and restoration; 2) event-based scene understanding and 3D vision. We conduct benchmark experiments for the existing methods in some representative research directions i.e., image reconstruction, deblurring, and object recognition, to identify some critical insights and problems. Finally, we have discussions regarding the challenges and provide new perspectives for inspiring more research studies.",
